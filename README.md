**Lumina** is a C++ game engine powered by Vulkan, built as a hands-on learning project. Inspired by engines like Unreal and Godot, it focuses on reflection, modularity, and a clean ImGui-based editor. The goal isn‚Äôt to become the next major engine or to optimize anyone‚Äôs workflow, but to serve as a passion project, a way to explore and experiment with the architectures that make up a full-fledged game engine.

# üõ†Ô∏è Building Lumina (Windows Only, please see disclaimer near top)

> ‚úÖ MSVC 17.8+ required  
> ‚ùå Linux/macOS support is not available yet

### Setup:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `Setup.py` (this extracts external dependencies).
3. Ensure you install VulkanMemoryAllocator whilst installing Vulkan.
4. Ensure the `LUMINA_DIR` environment variable is set to the engine install directory file path (e.g. C:/CoolStuff/LuminaGameEngine)
5. Run `Scripts/Win-GenProjects.py`.
6. Open the generated `.sln` in Visual Studio.
7. Build & Run the **Reflector** in `Release` mode.
8. Set **Editor** as startup project. Select Debug or Release mode.
9. Build & run.

## üß± Included Applications

- **Editor** ‚Äì ImGui-based main app
- **Sandbox** ‚Äì For API testing
- **Reflector** ‚Äì Generates reflection metadata

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Visual Studio 2022**
- **Python** (auto-installed if missing)
- **Vulkan SDK**

---

## üß≠ Roadmap

- ‚úÖ Windows support
- üîÑ Refactor to dynamic/shared libraries

## ü§ù Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!

> See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for code style and guidelines.

- ‚úÖ Tests, documentation, and clean commits required.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Style

- `F` prefix = internal engine types (non-reflected)
- `C` prefix = reflected types (classes)
- `S` prefix = reflected types (structs)
- PascalCase for all identifiers
- Tabs (not spaces), braces on new lines
- See [Coding Standards](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details.
